    Garlic buttered shrimp is made by marinating fresh large shrimp in lemon soda then sauteed and cooked in a sauce made with butter, tomato sauce, garlic, oyster sauce, salt, pepper and spring onions. This garlic buttered shrimp with sprite is best partnered with hot steaming rice as well as ice cold beer and is lower in fat and calories compared to most meats. This is definitely the answer to your seafood craving.</p>
